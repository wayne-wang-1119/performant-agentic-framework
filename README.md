# performant-agentic-framework

arena experiment code for PAF, including the dataset

# Setup

1. Install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2.  Generate the dataset

```bash
python data/generator.py
```

This will generate a dataset in the `data` folder called dataset.csv with the following columns:

- `SystemPromp`: The system prompt used in the experiment containing the Node navigation map with a simplified version of Agentic logic framework
- `Conversation History`: The conversation history of the user and the Agent, conversation turn back and forth generated by /data/generator.py
- `Golden Response`: The golden response that the Agent should respond with, generated first by the LLM then audited by Human Evaluation one by one to ensure the quality of the golden response from us to allow for testing truthfulness and contextual awareness of Agentic System in a simplified and obsecure setting.

3. Run the experiment

We leverage Evidently AI's Regression score to the alignment of the latest generation to the golden response.
